Core Framework and Tools

Python is a very popular high-level programming language that is great for data
science. Its ease of use and wide support within popular machine learning
platforms, coupled with a large catalog of ML libraries, has made it a leader
in this space.
Pandas is an open-source Python library designed for analyzing and manipulating data.
It is particularly good for working with tabular data and time-series data.
NumPy, like Pandas, is a Python library. NumPy provides support for large, 
multi-dimensional arrays of data, and has many high-level mathematical functions that
can be used to perform operations on these arrays.
Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Scikit-Learn is a Python library designed specifically for machine learning. It is 
designed to be integrated with other scientific and data-analysis libraries, such as
NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib (described below).
Apache Spark is an open-source analytics engine that is designed for cluster-computing
and that is often used for large-scale data processing and big data.
TensorFlow is a free, open-source software library for machine learning built by 
Google Brain.
Keras is a Python deep-learning library. It provide an Application Programming 
Interface (API) that can be used to interface with other libraries, such as TensorFlow, 
in order to program neural networks. Keras is designed for rapid development and 
experimentation.
PyTorch is an open source library for machine learning, developed in large part by 
Facebook's AI Research lab. It is known for being comparatively easy to use, especially
for developers already familiar with Python and a Pythonic code style.
Data Visualization

Plotly is not itself a library, but rather a company that provides a number of different
front-end tools for machine learning and data scienceâ€”including an open source graphing
library for Python.
Matplotlib is a Python library designed for plotting 2D visualizations. It can be used 
to produce graphs and other figures that are high quality and usable in professional 
publications. You'll see that the Matplotlib library is used by a number of other 
libraries and tools, such as SciKit Learn (above) and Seaborn (below). You can easily 
import Matplotlib for use in a Python script or to create visualizations within a Jupyter
Notebook.
Seaborn is a Python library designed specifically for data visualization. It is based on
matplotlib, but provides a more high-level interface and has additional features for 
making visualizations more attractive and informative.
Bokeh is an interactive data visualization library. In contrast to a library like 
matplotlib that generates a static image as its output, Bokeh generates visualizations in
HTML and JavaScript. This allows for web-based visualizations that can have interactive 
features.
